K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier Project: Iris Dataset
Project Description:
Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch to predict the species of Iris flowers based on various features. This project demonstrates the application of key machine learning concepts, such as distance metrics, classification, and model evaluation. The model was built using the Iris dataset and was compared against a pre-built KNN classifier from scikit-learn for accuracy validation.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Loaded the Iris dataset and split it into training and test sets using train_test_split.
Euclidean Distance Calculation: Defined a function to compute the Euclidean distance between data points, which is central to KNN.
KNN Algorithm: Built the KNN algorithm by implementing functions to find the nearest neighbors and predict labels based on majority voting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics and compared the custom KNN implementation with scikit-learnâ€™s KNeighborsClassifier.
Skills Used:
Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Euclidean Distance, Voting System
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Model Validation
Data Preprocessing: Data Splitting, Feature Normalization

Linear Regression and Least Squares Classifier for Iris Dataset
This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression models and a custom least squares classifier for predicting Iris species and analyzing linear relationships.

Linear Regression Model:
Linear Regression without Noise: Defined a simple linear equation y = 2x + 1 and trained a model using LinearRegression from sklearn.
Linear Regression with Noise: Introduced random noise to the data and retrained the model to show how noise affects the regression line and its parameters.
Visualization: Plotted both the original data and noisy data along with their respective regression lines to visually compare the effect of noise.
Least Squares Classifier:
Implemented a custom Least Squares Classifier to perform binary classification of Iris species using the Iris dataset.
Split the dataset into training and test sets and visualized the decision boundary for classifying two species of Iris.
Evaluated the classifier's performance with a scatter plot displaying the classified points for test data.
Libraries Used:
NumPy: For mathematical and array operations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing regression lines and decision boundaries.
Scikit-learn: For model training and data preprocessing.
Seaborn: For visualizing data relationships and patterns.
