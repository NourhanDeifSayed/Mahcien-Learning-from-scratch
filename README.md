K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier Project: Iris Dataset
Project Description:
Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch to predict the species of Iris flowers based on various features. This project demonstrates the application of key machine learning concepts, such as distance metrics, classification, and model evaluation. The model was built using the Iris dataset and was compared against a pre-built KNN classifier from scikit-learn for accuracy validation.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Loaded the Iris dataset and split it into training and test sets using train_test_split.
Euclidean Distance Calculation: Defined a function to compute the Euclidean distance between data points, which is central to KNN.
KNN Algorithm: Built the KNN algorithm by implementing functions to find the nearest neighbors and predict labels based on majority voting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics and compared the custom KNN implementation with scikit-learnâ€™s KNeighborsClassifier.
Skills Used:
Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Euclidean Distance, Voting System
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Model Validation
Data Preprocessing: Data Splitting, Feature Normalization
